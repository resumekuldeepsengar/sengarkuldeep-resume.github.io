    In Gojek I am leading the Allocations team responsible for finding and allocating the best driver for a given order. It is one of the most critical services of Gojek processing more than 3 million orders a day. 
    **Highlights**
    - Overhauled the allocations service to provide an alternate way of allocations by aggregating the demand over time and applying objective functions to optimize the allocation pipeline. 
    - Led the migration of the services in Marketplace from VMs to kubernetes without any downtime to achieve a greater elasticity and scalability. This has saved more than $ 200k per year for the company.
